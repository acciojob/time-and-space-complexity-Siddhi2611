  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a way to represent how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the input size. A more efficient algorithm will have lower time complexity for the same task.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of input size. It is often represented using notations like O(n), where n is the size of the input.
